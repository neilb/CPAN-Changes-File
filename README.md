# CPAN Changes File

This is a proposed spec for CPAN Changes files, and a lash-up parser.

HAARG has been working on a parser, and without even seeing it, I suspect
that his may will be what we go forward with, assuming we can't work out
a way to support this within the existing CPAN::Changes module.
